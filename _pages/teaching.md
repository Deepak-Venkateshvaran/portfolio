2023/2024  

1. I co-teach a course on Energy Harvesting (course code NE.10) within the [MPhil Programme in Micro- & Nanotechnology Enterprise](https://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/pg-study/mphil-programme-micro-nanotechnology-enterprise). My lectures focus on thermal energy harvesting (thermoelectrics and pyroelectrics), mechanical energy harvesting (piezoelectrics), and an introduction to science policy in government. Our global roadmap for energy harvesting materials was published by the Institute of Physics in 2023, and can be accessed [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7639/acc550).

2. I also co-teach a course on Materials, Electronics & Renewable Energy (course code IDP3). This is a Part III Physics lecture course at the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University. My lectures focus on fuel cells, hydrogen as an energy source, and the hydrogen economy.

3.  I am the Director of Studies in Physics at Selwyn College Cambridge with responsibilities for students doing the Part 1B (second year), Part II (third year), and Part III (fourth year/masters level) in Physics.
