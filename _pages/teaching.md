2023/2024  
Together with [Dr Ibrahim Dar](https://www.oe.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-ibrahim-dar), I will be teaching the course on Energy Harvesting (NE.10) within the [MPhil Programme in Micro- & Nanotechnology Enterprise](https://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/pg-study/mphil-programme-micro-nanotechnology-enterprise). My lectures will focus on thermoelectric energy harvesting.

I am also the Director of Studies in Physics at Selwyn College with responsibilities for students doing the Part 1B (second year), Part II (third year), and Part III (fourth year/masters level) in Physics.
