In 2023/2024, I will be teaching part of the course on Energy Harvesting (NE.10) within the [MPhil Programme in Micro- & Nanotechnology Enterprise](https://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/pg-study/mphil-programme-micro-nanotechnology-enterprise). 

I am also the Director of Studies in Physics at Selwyn College with responsibilities for students doing the Part 1B (second year), Part II (third year) and Part III (fourth year/masters level) in Physics.
