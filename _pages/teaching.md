2023/2024  

1.  Together with Dr Ibrahim Dar, I will be teaching a course on Energy Harvesting (NE.10) within the [MPhil Programme in Micro- & Nanotechnology Enterprise](https://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/pg-study/mphil-programme-micro-nanotechnology-enterprise). My lectures will focus on thermal energy harvesting. Our global roadmap for energy harvesting materials was published by the Institute of Physics in 2023, and can be accessed [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7639/acc550).

2.  Jointly with Prof Akshay Rao, I will teach a course on Materials, Electronics & Renewable Energy (called IDP3 within the Natural Sciences Tripos). This is a Part III Physics lecture course at the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University. My lectures will focus on fuel cells and hydrogen as an energy source.

3.  I am the Director of Studies in Physics at Selwyn College Cambridge with responsibilities for students doing the Part 1B (second year), Part II (third year), and Part III (fourth year/masters level) in Physics.
