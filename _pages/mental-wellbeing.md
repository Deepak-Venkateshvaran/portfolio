We are products of social programming. Our societal circles dictate what is expected of us, and what constitutes right and wrong. We please with the subconscious intent to conform. Conformity offers us community.

When we are young, we have little ability to influence our way of thinking. As a grown up, we believe the way we think and how we organise ourselves constitutes our personality. 

Why do we sometimes behave the way we do? What moral code of judgement do we lean on? How much of our decisions are subconsciously driven by fear? These are questions we don't often stop to ask ourselves.

There comes a point when a spanner is thrown in the works forcing us to question our ways. These catalytic moments stem from the most difficult times in our lives. They could be the death of a loved one, a relationship breakup, sudden illness, the loss of an opportunity we deeply craved for, or others of similar gravity. On occasion, they may even be inspired by envy. Such moments force us to question what works for our life and what doesn't. Are we indeed getting the most from our short time on the planet or are we only engaging in a tick box exercise to please the anonymous face of society. 

Tough moments have the energy to inspire resilience, institute change, and foster growth. They motivate us to re-invent, to arise, and to become the best versions of ourselves. Tough moments inspire us to observe that voice in our heads, and appreciate that the biggest battles we wage are the ones we fight in our mind, with our preconditioned selves. 

The personal development that comes from healing our emotional wounds and from rectifying our pre-programmed habits helps us live our futures with intent. It helps us live with compassion for ourselves. It helps us share love without condition.

Here is a selection of books that helped me on my own personal growth journey. They helped me move towards a space of gratitude, peace, and inner contentment.

The bottom line is this.  

- _Be kind. Both to yourself, and to others._  
- _It may sound corny, but love is the answer. Love unconditionally._  
- _Be grateful for the cards handed to you in life. No one has them all good. No one has them all bad._  
- _Bless those that treat you with indifference. They help you grow._  
- _Comparison steals your joy. Focus on yourself and your personal development._
- _Let go. Create life goals from inspiration and not desperation. Engage in thought, not thinking._
