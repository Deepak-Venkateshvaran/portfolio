We are all products of social programming. Our social circles subtly or openly tell us what is expected of us, and what constitues right and wrong. We please with the intent to conform, for conformation offers us community. When young, we have little choice or ability to influence our way of thinking. As a grown up, we believe that the way we think and organise ourselves constitutes our personality. All through, life subjects us to trauma in ways we never comprehend. Left unchecked and unchallenged, we continue to live our lives on autopilot for decades.

There comes a point when life's experience throws a spanner in the works, forcing us to question our ways. These catalytic moments often come from some of the most difficult times in our lives. It could be the death of a loved one, a relationship breakup, sudden illness, the loss of an opportunity we deeply craved for, or others of similar gravity. On occasion, it may even be inspired by envy. Such moments force us to question what works for our life, and what doesn't. Are we indeed getting the most out of our time on the planet, or are we just doing a tick box exercise to please the anonymous face of society. 

These tough moments inspire resilience, change, and growth. They inspire us to re-invent. To raise. And to become the best versions of ourselves. They inspire us to understand that the voice in our heads is not always our friend, and that the biggest battles we wage are the one's with fight in our own heads.

With conscious effort, concerted action, and the passage of time, we can begin to live with intent. We can live with compassion for ourselves. We can share love with all those we come in contact with. We can heal.

Here are five books that inspired my own personal growth. They helped me move from the depths of life's darkness and despair to a place of gratitude, peace and inner contentment. I continue to be work in progress, for anything built for the long haul, is only built on continuous  hard work and conscious effort.
