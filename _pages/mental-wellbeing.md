_"Every life crisis carries within it the kernels of a reversal, a renewal, an expansion, a leap in consciousness, and a letting go of the old and a birth of the new - David R. Hawkins"_



The societies we grow up in shape the way we think. Our early life's experience moulds how we emotionally experience the world. The people we grew up with hand us a rule book on how life is to be lived. Most of our thoughts and opinions are not really our own. They are planted into us throughout our lives. Guardians, gurus, peers, and the media; they all play a role in how we are programmed. As young people, we have little ability to influence our way of thinking. Later in life, we believe that our interests, drives, values, abilities, and emotional patterns constitute our personality. 

What dictates our habits and our emotional reactions to situations? What moral code of judgement do we lean on? Do we subconsciously project our subjective thinking onto the words and actions of others? Are we aware of our actions that are driven by fear? Should we reparent ourselves later in life? These are questions we don't often stop to ask.

There comes a point when a spanner is thrown in the works forcing us to question our ways. These catalytic moments stem from the most difficult times in our lives. They could be the death of a loved one, a relationship breakup, sudden illness, the loss of an opportunity we deeply craved for, or others of similar gravity. On occasion, they may even be inspired by envy. Such moments make us question what works for us, and what doesn't. Are we indeed getting the most from our short time on the planet, or are we subconsciously being held back by our preprogrammed behaviour, and repetitive thoughts. 

Tough moments have the energy to inspire resilience, institute change, and foster growth. They motivate us to re-invent, to arise, and to become better versions of ourselves. Tough moments inspire us to observe that voice in our heads, and appreciate that the biggest battles we wage are the ones we fight in our mind, with our preconditioned selves. 

The personal development that comes from healing our emotional wounds, and from correcting our pre-programmed habits and limiting beliefs, helps us live with intent. It helps us live with respect and compassion for ourselves. It helps us share love with others without condition.

The bottom line is this.  

- _Be kind. Both to yourself, and to others._  
- _It may sound corny, but love is the answer. Love unconditionally._  
- _Be grateful for the cards handed to you in life. No one has them all good. No one has them all bad._  
- _Bless those that treat you with indifference. They help you grow._  
- _Comparison steals your joy. Focus on yourself and your personal development._
- _Let go. Create life goals from inspiration and not desperation. Engage in thought, not thinking._
