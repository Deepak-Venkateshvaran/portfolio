We are all products of social programming. Our social circles subtly or openly tell us what we should do, what is expected, and what consititues right and wrong. We please with the intent to conform, for it is conformation that offers us a community. When young, we have little choice or ability to influence our ways of thinking. When older, we believe that the way we think and organise ourselves constitutes our personality. All through, life subjects us to trauma in ways we never understand, and when left unchecked and unchallenged, we continue to live on autopilot for decades.

There comes a point when life's experience throws a spanner in the works and forces us to question our ways. These catalytic moments often come from some of the most difficult times in our lives. It could be the death of a loved one, a relationship breakup, sudden illness, the loss of an opportunity we so deeply craved for. It may even be inspired by envy. Such moments force us to question what works in our life and what doesn't. Are we indeed getting the most out of our time in life, or are we checking the boxes just to please the anonymous face of society. 

These moments inspire resilience, change, and growth. They inspire us to re-invent, and to become the best versions of ourselves. They inspire us to understand that the voice in our heads is not always our friend, and that the biggest battles we wage are the one's with that very voice.

With much conscious effort, and with the passiing of the years, we can begin to live with intent. To live with compassion for ourselves. To give share love with all whom we come in contact with. To heal.

Here are five books that inspired my own personal growth. They helped me move from the depths of life's darkness and despair to a place of gratitude, peace and inner contentment. Of course, I continue to be work in progress, for to build anything worthy is to continue putting in the cconscious effort.
