I have played the Indian *tabla* for several decades, and routinely perform with well known world musicians like [Catherine Groom](https://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/directory/catherine-groom), [Hibiki Ichikawa](https://hibikishamisen.com/), and [Hidé Takemoto](https://www.hideguitar.com/). 

In 2021, Hidé Takemoto and I started a music-art project called "Fingers HQ". The goal of Fingers HQ is to showcase the intricate finger action on both the tabla and the guitar that releases the sound one hears as music.  
Few examples of our Fingers HQ project are at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/@FingersHQ).


**Tabla and Physics**

The unique construction of the *tabla* and the vibrational properties of its loaded membrane has very important consequences for microscale device physics. It offers a unique solution to a long-standing problem in polymer-based micromechanical systems, where the quality of resonance is known to be low. Together with my colleague, Mr Matthew Smith, we highlight this problem and its solution. Our article can be read on page 52 of the Selwyn College Calendar 2022-2023, reproduced below.
