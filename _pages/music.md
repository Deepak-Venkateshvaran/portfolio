I have played the Indian *tabla* for several decades, and routinely perform with well known world musicians like [Catherine Groom](https://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/directory/catherine-groom), [Hibiki Ichikawa](https://hibikishamisen.com/), and [Hidé Takemoto](https://www.hideguitar.com/). 

Hidé Takemoto and I run a music-art project called [Fingers HQ](https://www.youtube.com/@FingersHQ). The goal of Fingers HQ is to highlight the intricate finger action on the tabla and the guitar. It is this finger action that releases sound one hears as music.


## Tabla and Physics

The unique construction of the tabla and the vibrational properties of its loaded membrane have important consequences for microscale device physics. They offer a unique solution to a long-standing problem in polymer-based micromechanical systems, where the quality of resonance of a vibrating microscale polymer membrane is known to be low. Together with my colleague, [Mr Matthew Smith](https://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/people/mr-matthew-smith), we highlight this problem and our solution inspired by the  tabla. Our article can be read on [page 52](https://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-11/Selwyn%20Calendar%202022-23.pdf#page=27) of the Selwyn College Calendar 2022-2023.
