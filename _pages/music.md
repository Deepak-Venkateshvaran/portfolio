I have played the Indian *tabla* for several decades, and routinely perform with well known world musicians like [Catherine Groom](https://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/directory/catherine-groom), [Hibiki Ichikawa](https://hibikishamisen.com/), and [Hidé Takemoto](https://www.hideguitar.com/). 

In 2021, Hidé Takemoto and I started a music-art project called "Fingers HQ". The goal of Fingers HQ is to showcase the intricate finger action on both the tabla and the guitar that releases the sound one hears as music.  
Few examples of our Fingers HQ project are at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/@FingersHQ).
