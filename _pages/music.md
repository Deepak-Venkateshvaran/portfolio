I have played the Indian *tabla* for several decades, and routinely perform with well known musicians such as [Hibiki Ichikawa](https://hibikishamisen.com/), [Catherine Groom] (https://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/directory/catherine-groom) and [Hidé Takemoto](https://www.hideguitar.com/). 
In 2021, Hidé Takemoto and I started a music-art project called "Fingers HQ". The goal of Fingers HQ is to showcase the intricate finger action on the tabla and on the guitar that releases sound. 
Few examples of the Fingers HQ project are at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/@FingersHQ)
