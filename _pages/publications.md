I have worked primarily in three research areas of experimental physics over my career till date;  
Thermoelectrics, Spintronics, and Nanomechanics.  

In no chronological order, below are my top publications together with a brief summary of what we achieved in them. 


## Thermoelectrics

Deepak Venkateshvaran, Mark Nikolka *et al.*, **Nature** 515, 384â€“388 (2014)  
*World's first demonstration of how thermoelectric effects can be used to quantify disorder in organic polymers*  

Deepak Venkateshvaran *et al.*, **APL Materials** 2, 032102 (2014)  
*Novel measurement of voltage modulated thermoelectric effects in a polymer transistor device*  

Katharina Broch, Deepak Venkateshvaran *et al.*, **Advanced Electronic Materials** 3, 1700225 (2017)  
*Pioneering demonstration of bipolar thermoelectric coefficients in a polymer transistor device*  
 

## Spintronics 

Shu-Jen Wang, Deepak Venkateshvaran *et al.*, **Nature Electronics** 2, 98-107 (2019)  
*A broad-spectrum study of the difficulties in achieving all-electrical spin injection into organic semiconductors*  

Deepak Venkateshvaran *et al.*, **Physical Review B** 78, 092405 (2008)  
*Discovery of a universal scaling behaviour in the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic oxides*  


## Nanomechanics
