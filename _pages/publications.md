I have worked primarily in three research areas of experimental physics over my career till date;  
Thermoelectrics, Spintronics, and Nanomechanics.  
Below are my top publications together with a brief summary of what we achieved in them. 

## Thermoelectrics

Deepak Venkateshvaran *et al.*, Nature 515, 384â€“388 (2014) - *Demonstration of how thermoelectric effects can be used to quantify disorder in organic polymers*  

Deepak Venkateshvaran *et al.*, APL Materials 2, 032102 (2014) - *Demonstration of voltage modulated thermoelectric effects in a polymer transistor device*  

Katharina Broch, Deepak Venkateshvaran *et al.*, Advanced Electronic Materials 3, 1700225 (2017) - *Demonstration of ambipolar thermoelectric coefficients in a polymer transistor device*  
 

## Spintronics 

Shu-Jen Wang, Deepak Venkateshvaran *et al.*, Nature Electronics 2, 98-107 (2019) - *A broad-spectrum study of the difficulties in achieving all-electrical spin injection into organic semiconductors*  

Deepak Venkateshvaran *et al.*, Physical Review B 79, 134405 (2009) - *Discovery of a universal scaling behaviour in the Anomalous Hall effect in magnetic oxides*  

## Nanomechanics
Illia Dobryden, V. V. Korolkov, ... & Deepak Venkateshvaran, Nature Communications 13, 3076 (2022) - *Demonstration of ultrahigh contrast nanomechanics in an organic polymer film*
