I have worked primarily in three research areas of experimental physics over my career; Thermoelectrics, Spintronics, and Nanomechanics.  
Below are my top ten key publications in these areas with a one line description of what we achieved. These ten papers are the ones in which I played a major role. The list below does not contain papers where I was co-author for minor involvement.  
My [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=otuUyXIAAAAJ&hl=en) profile documents my complete list of publications.
