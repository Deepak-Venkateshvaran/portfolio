I have worked primarily in three research areas of experimental physics over my career till date;  
Thermoelectrics, Spintronics, and Nanomechanics.  
Below are my top 10 publications in these areas together with a brief summary of what we achieved. 

These 10 papers are the ones in which I played a major role, i.e., architecting the project, doing the experiments, building and sustaining collaborations, writing the papers, and more recently, co-ordinating with publishing editors.  
This list does not contain papers in which I was co-author for minor involvement.  
My [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=otuUyXIAAAAJ&hl=en) profile documents my complete list of publications.
