I have worked primarily in three research areas of experimental physics over my career till date;  
Thermoelectrics, Spintronics, and Nanomechanics.  
Below are my top publications in these areas together with a brief summary of what we achieved in them.

My [Google Scholar] (https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=otuUyXIAAAAJ&hl=en) profile documents my complete list of publications.
