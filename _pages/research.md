My research interests focus on the interplay between electronics, thermoelectrics, and nanomechanics.  

First, we measure fundamental quantities that characterise the motion of charge carriers in organic semiconducting materials. These are quantitites such as how conductive the materials are (conductivity), how mobile the charge carriers in them tend to be (mobility), and how well the materials convert temperature differences into voltages (Seebeck coefficient). We perform our measurements using microscale and nanoscale devices.  
This portion of my work has applications in waste heat harvesting.  

Second, we implement new force-mapping techniques on the nanoscale for high-resolution nanoscale mechanics and for high-resolution imaging. In this work, we quantify material properties such as stiffness and modulus (elasticity) on the nanoscale.  

Our ultimate goal is to build a framework that links experimentally measured propperties of mobiity, conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and elasticity to investigate physical models summarised in the diagram below. In doing so, we are able to understand and characterise the physics of organic multi-functional materials.

**Research Consortium**  
I run my research program jointly with collaborators in Stockholm, Sweden, namely [Prof Per Claesson](https://www.kth.se/profile/percl), [Dr Illia Dobryden](https://www.ri.se/en/person/illia-dobryden) and Dr Ki-Hwan Hwang, and through an academia-industry partnership with [Dr Vladimir Korolkov](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-korolkov-26125452) at [Park Systems](https://www.parksystems.com/). Within Cambridge, I collaborate closely with [Prof Ljiljana Fruk](https://www.fruk-lab.com/) and with [Dr Leszek J. Spalek](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/leszekspalek) to expand the systems we study to include biological matter. This work is funded through research grants I hold from the Royal Society.

In 2024, I will initiate a new program on molecular thermoelectrics with [Dr Guillaume Schweicher](https://chimpoly.ulb.be/guillaume-schweicher/) at the ULB in Belgium, funded through a Wiener Anspach Foundation research grant.

A small part of my research program is completely blue skies. One example of this is to treat nanoscale topography information topologically, and apply novel tools such as Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Geometric Data Analysis (GDA) to evaluate atomic force microscopy images. This work is funded in part by the Royal Society and in part through UNAM in Mexico. It is conducted together with [Prof Pablo Padilla](https://mym.iimas.unam.mx/pablo/index.html), Mr Alberto Alcalá Alvarez and Mr Mateo Tonatiuh Rodríguez Cervantes.

On the topic of people, I paraphrase my late mentor [Prof B. S. Chandrashekar](https://artsci.case.edu/artsci-update-archive/b-s-chandrasekhar-former-dean-of-the-college-passes-away-at-93/), "As in life, so in academic career... people will come and go. Irrespective of their age, or their education level, they will all leave an imprint on us, intellectual and behavioural. Be a friend of the world, stay curious, and walk through life believing you have something to learn from all who cross your road."  
I very much live by these words.

On the topic of teams and team culture, I quote Brian Chesky, "The best culture is one shared consciousness, where everything in your head, everything you care about is permeated throughout the people, and people would do, in a room without you, what they would do if you were there."  
These words inspire an openness I aspire to.
