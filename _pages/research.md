My research interests broadly span the physics of new materials for energy harvesting, and the development of novel nanoscale imaging techniques for ambient high-resolution microscopy and nanoscale mechanics.  

I run my research program jointly with collaborators in Stockholm, Sweden, namely [Prof Per Claesson](https://www.kth.se/profile/percl), [Illia Dobryden](https://www.ri.se/en/person/illia-dobryden) and Ki-Hwan Hwang, and through an academia-industry link with [Dr Vladimir Korolkov](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-korolkov-26125452) at Park Systems. Within Cambridge, I work closely with [Prof Ljiljana Fruk](https://www.fruk-lab.com/) and with [Dr Leszek J. Spalek](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/leszekspalek) to expand the systems we study to biological matter.

What makes the enterprise of academic research a very rewarding one are the people we work and collaborate with. As an independent reserach fellow at Cambridge University, I have the immense pleasure of working with a team of very talented and very highly qualified researchers from whom I have learned much over the years. While it has become customary for research group leaders to document a list of members of their team on their websites, I harbour a slightly different philosophy on this issue, and it is one I've adopted from my late mentor [Prof B. S. Chandrashekar](https://artsci.case.edu/artsci-update-archive/b-s-chandrasekhar-former-dean-of-the-college-passes-away-at-93/). 

To paraphrase Prof B. S. Chandra's words, "As in life, so in career, people will come and go. Irrespective of their age, or their education, they will leave an imprint on us, intellectual and behavioural. Be a friend of the world, stay curious, and walk though life believing you have something to learn from everyone that crosses your road."

In this spirirt, I wish to acknowledge the following people that I work with regularly, not only for contributing to my research agenda, but for givning me the continuous opportunity to develop through their association. Some of them are paid for by my own research grants either in full or in part, while the others collaborate with me on joint projects through third party funding.
