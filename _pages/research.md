My current research interests broadly span the physics of soft organic and molecular materials for energy applications, and the development of novel nanoscale imaging techniques for ambient high-resolution nanoscopy and nanoscale mechanics.


**Research Consortium**  
I run my research program jointly with collaborators in Stockholm, Sweden, namely [Prof Per Claesson](https://www.kth.se/profile/percl), [Dr Illia Dobryden](https://www.ri.se/en/person/illia-dobryden) and Dr Ki-Hwan Hwang, and through an academia-industry partnership with [Dr Vladimir Korolkov](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-korolkov-26125452) at [Park Systems](https://www.parksystems.com/). Within Cambridge, I work closely with [Prof Ljiljana Fruk](https://www.fruk-lab.com/) and with [Dr Leszek J. Spalek](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/leszekspalek) to expand the systems we study to include biological matter.

Others that I continue working with on funded projects include [Dr Guillaume Schweicher](https://chimpoly.ulb.be/guillaume-schweicher/), [Prof Pablo Padilla](https://mym.iimas.unam.mx/pablo/index.html), Mr Alberto Alcalá Alvarez and Mr Mateo Tonatiuh Rodríguez Cervantes.

To paraphrase my late mentor [Prof B. S. Chandrashekar](https://artsci.case.edu/artsci-update-archive/b-s-chandrasekhar-former-dean-of-the-college-passes-away-at-93/), "As in life, so in academic career... people will come and go. Irrespective of their age, or their education, they will all leave an imprint on us, intellectual and behavioural. Be a friend of the world, stay curious, and walk through life believing you have something to learn from all who cross your road."

I very much live by these words.
