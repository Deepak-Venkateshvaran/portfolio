My current research interests broadly span the physics of soft organic and molecular materials for energy applications, and the development of novel nanoscale imaging techniques for ambient high-resolution nanoscopy and nanoscale mechanics.

I run my research program jointly with collaborators in Stockholm, Sweden, namely [Prof Per Claesson](https://www.kth.se/profile/percl), [Dr Illia Dobryden](https://www.ri.se/en/person/illia-dobryden) and Dr Ki-Hwan Hwang, and through an academia-industry partnership with [Dr Vladimir Korolkov](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-korolkov-26125452) at [Park Systems](https://www.parksystems.com/). Within Cambridge, I work closely with [Prof Ljiljana Fruk](https://www.fruk-lab.com/) and with [Dr Leszek J. Spalek](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/leszekspalek) to expand the systems we study to include biological matter.

Others that I continue working with on funded projects include [Prof Pablo Padilla](https://mym.iimas.unam.mx/pablo/index.html), Mr Alberto Alcalá Alvarez, Mr Mateo Tonatiuh Rodríguez Cervantes and [Dr Guillaume Schweicher](https://chimpoly.ulb.be/guillaume-schweicher/).

While it has become customary for research group leaders to document a list of members of their team on their websites, I harbour a slightly different philosophy on this issue, and it is one I've adopted from my late mentor [Prof B. S. Chandrashekar](https://artsci.case.edu/artsci-update-archive/b-s-chandrasekhar-former-dean-of-the-college-passes-away-at-93/). 

To paraphrase Prof B. S. Chandra's words, "As in life, so in career... people will come and go. Irrespective of their age, or their education, they will leave an imprint on us, intellectual and behavioural. Be a friend of the world, stay curious, and walk through life believing you have something to learn from everyone that crosses your road. Strict adherance to hierarchy can impose a limit on your learning."
