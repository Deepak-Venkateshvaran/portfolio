My research interests broadly span the physics of soft organic and molecular materials for energy applications, and the development of novel nanoscale imaging techniques for ambient high-resolution nanoscopy and nanoscale mechanics.

I run my research program jointly with collaborators in Stockholm, Sweden, namely [Prof Per Claesson](https://www.kth.se/profile/percl), [Dr Illia Dobryden](https://www.ri.se/en/person/illia-dobryden) and Dr Ki-Hwan Hwang, and through an academia-industry parnetship with [Dr Vladimir Korolkov](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-korolkov-26125452) at [Park Systems](https://www.parksystems.com/). Within Cambridge, I work closely with [Prof Ljiljana Fruk](https://www.fruk-lab.com/) and with [Dr Leszek J. Spalek](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/leszekspalek) to expand the systems we study to include biological matter.

While it has become customary for research group leaders to document a list of members of their team on their websites, I harbour a slightly different philosophy on this issue, and it is one I've adopted from my late mentor [Prof B. S. Chandrashekar](https://artsci.case.edu/artsci-update-archive/b-s-chandrasekhar-former-dean-of-the-college-passes-away-at-93/). 

To paraphrase Prof B. S. Chandra's words, "As in life, so in career... people will come and go. Irrespective of their age, or their education, they will leave an imprint on us, intellectual and behavioural. Be a friend of the world, stay curious, and walk though life believing you have something to learn from everyone that crosses your road."
