I am an academic at the University of Cambridge. My responsibilities span research, teaching and leadership. 

**Research**   
I hold a Royal Society University Research Fellowship at the Cavendish Laboratory where our team conducts research on nanoscale mechanics and new imaging techniques. We study multifunctional soft matter systems from organic semiconductors to biological matter. 

**Teaching**  
I am a Fellow, College Lecturer, and Director of Studies in Physics at Selwyn College Cambridge. At Selwyn, I am responsible for teaching and teaching-related activities that span interviewing prospective undergraduate applicants, organising tutorials and supervisions, and monitoring the academic performance of students within the Natural Sciences Tripos. In addition, I teach masters level courses at the University on the topic of energy harvesting technologies.

**Leadership**  
I am a trustee at Selwyn College Cambridge, and serve on committees to help make Cambridge accessible to students from economically underperforming parts of the country. I also sit on the graduate student funding committee at the Cavendish Laboroatory to aid in joint decision making around funding for postgraduate applicants. In 2024, I will begin a secondment on science policy at the UK Government.
