I am a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge, and a Director of Studies at Selwyn College Cambridge. My research interests focus on nanoscale mechaincs and new imaging techniques of soft systems, from organic semiconductors to biological matter.
